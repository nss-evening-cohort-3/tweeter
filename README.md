## Purpose
This is an instructor-lead code-along with homework elements for the students. Submitted answers to this assignment requires a Pull Request.

## Setup & Bootstrapping

1. Fork this repo.
2. Add a remote named `upstream` [pointing to the main repository](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/).

## Naming Conventions

### Instructor Branches
During instructor led coding, all work will be placed on a branch that matches the date. Fo instance, for a class held on June 5th, the name of the branch containing the instructor's work is `jun_05`.

### Assignment Branches
For student assignments, submissions will be placed on a branch titled by the instructor. All assignment submission must be placed on a branch that **exactly matches** the branch name provided by the instructor for tht assignment.

## Following Along

- The students will be tasked each day to create a branch for that day as they may be expected to 'code-along'.
- The students must commit all changes and push that day's branch to their fork **before** the end of class.
- At the beginning of each class, the student is responsible for obtaining `upstream` changes. See [Syncing a Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) for more information.

## Features

See [FEATURES.md](https://github.com/nss-evening-cohort-3/tweeter/blob/master/FEATURES.md) to see what will be implemented.
