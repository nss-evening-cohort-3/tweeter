OUTTA CLASS WORK:

   -> Also, update Register page form to remove label and use placeholders for the fields
* Update the navbar according to the mockup
* Update the home page to have the top "hero" area with a join button according to the mockup
* Be sure to submit this via pull request to your repo. Don't forget to push up and submit the request before class on Saturday!

NOTES -- "according to the mockup" doesn't mean pixel for pixel representation. Just follow the gist of what the mockup represents.
